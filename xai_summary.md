Explainable AI (XAI) in Predictive Modeling: Project Summary

Project Overview
This project involves building a machine learning model to detect fraudulent transactions using the Credit Card Fraud dataset. The main focus is to not only develop an effective predictive model but also to implement Explainable AI (XAI) techniques to ensure interpretability and transparency.

Model Summary
- Algorithm: RandomForest Classifier
- Dataset: Credit Card Fraud Detection dataset
- Feature Scaling: StandardScaler was used for feature scaling.
- Evaluation Metrics: Accuracy, ROC AUC, and feature importance were analyzed to determine the model's performance.

The RandomForest model was trained to classify transactions as fraudulent or non-fraudulent. The performance metrics indicated that the model is well-suited for identifying fraudulent transactions, especially in a highly imbalanced dataset.

 Explainability Using SHAP and LIME
To improve trust and transparency, SHAP (SHapley Additive exPlanations) and LIME (Local Interpretable Model-Agnostic Explanations) were used to interpret the model's predictions.

- SHAP Summary Plot: Provided an overall picture of feature importance, highlighting which features contributed the most to model predictions.
- LIME Explanations: Offered localized insights by explaining individual predictions, helping to identify why a specific transaction was classified as fraud.

 Key SHAP Dependence Plot Insights
SHAP dependence plots were generated for the top 4 most important features (`V16`, `V14`, `V12`, `V17`) based on feature importance. Here are the main findings:

1. Feature V16:
   - Negative values of `V16` were highly indicative of fraudulent behavior.
   - Interaction with `V4` influenced the impact of `V16` further, where higher values of `V4` increased the SHAP value for `V16`.

2. Feature V14:
   - Similar to `V16`, lower values of `V14` had a significant positive impact on predicting fraud.
   - The feature interaction with `V19` suggested that higher values of `V19` amplified the importance of `V14`.

3. Feature V12:
   - Negative values of `V12` were associated with a higher likelihood of fraud.
   - Feature `V27` influenced the impact of `V12`, with higher `V27` values correlating with increased SHAP values.

4. Feature V17:
   - `V17` had a pronounced effect on fraud predictions, particularly in the range of -25 to -10.
   - The interaction with `V14` showed that high values of `V14` increased the effect of `V17` on the model's predictions.

 Common Observations
- Negative Feature Values: All the key features (`V16`, `V14`, `V12`, `V17`) showed that lower values led to a higher probability of fraud prediction.
- Feature Interactions: The SHAP dependence plots indicated significant interactions between features. These interactions often amplified the contribution of the main features to the model's fraud predictions.

 Bias and Limitations
- Bias Assessment: There was a notable emphasis on negative values for most features in determining fraud, suggesting potential bias in how the model learns from the data. It is crucial to ensure that these features genuinely reflect fraudulent activity and do not introduce unintended biases.
- Imbalanced Dataset: Since the dataset was highly imbalanced, the model's performance may favor the majority class. Careful consideration was given to metrics like ROC AUC to ensure balanced evaluation.

 Conclusions and Recommendations
- Feature Importance: Features such as `V16`, `V14`, `V12`, and `V17` play a major role in detecting fraudulent behavior. Their negative values are key indicators of fraudulent transactions.
- Actionable Insights: The interactions identified in the SHAP dependence plots suggest that multiple features together can provide stronger indications of fraud. It is recommended to use these insights to create more nuanced fraud detection rules.
- Next Steps: Further refinement of the model could involve testing simpler models for interpretability, and assessing additional methods to mitigate biases, such as upsampling or using different evaluation metrics for imbalanced datasets.

 Final Deliverable
- Visualizations: The SHAP dependence plots and LIME explanations have been documented to illustrate the model’s behavior.
- Documentation: This report, alongside the generated visuals and the code repository, forms the final deliverable for this project. The visualizations provide an in-depth understanding of how the model makes its decisions, contributing to transparency and trust in the model’s predictions.
