Customer Segmentation Analysis Using RFM
Overview: This project involves customer segmentation of a retail dataset using Recency, Frequency, and Monetary (RFM) analysis. The main aim is to segment customers into distinct groups based on their purchasing behavior to enable better-targeted marketing strategies and boost business efficiency.

Goals:

Identify key customer groups such as "Best Customers," "Loyal Customers," and those "At Risk."
Provide actionable insights for personalized marketing and customer retention strategies.
Key Components:

Data Cleaning: Removed invalid data, such as missing customer IDs, to ensure quality insights.
RFM Metrics Calculation: Defined and computed Recency, Frequency, and Monetary metrics using SQL and Python.
Customer Segmentation: Assigned RFM scores to segment customers into distinct categories.
Visualization: Created plots to visually represent customer segments and spending trends to derive meaningful insights.
Key Insights:

Best Customers: Identified customers who scored high across recency, frequency, and monetary metrics.
Customer Purchase Behavior: Determined that Thursdays had the highest number of recent purchases, providing opportunities to schedule effective promotions on that day.
Data-Driven Strategies: Based on the segmentation, businesses can focus on rewarding their best customers while also targeting "At Risk" customers with re-engagement campaigns.
Tools Used:

SQL (SQLite) for data extraction and metric calculations.
Pandas for data manipulation.
Seaborn & Matplotlib for creating insightful visualizations.
Google Colab as the coding environment.
